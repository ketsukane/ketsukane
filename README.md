<p align="center">  heres some things that may be helpful to know before interacting with me:</p>
<p align="center"> im usually very sociable, i love talking with *just* about anybody. with exceptions of course. (see dni)   </p>
<p align="center"> but, genuinely, im very extroverted online. comfortable silence is appealing to me too though! please sit with me! ^_^   </p>
<p align="center"> i like to make gifted rentrys/adjacent sites for my friends! i like to edit and id be happy to make one for you. just be patient and dont take advantage of this, please. As well as rentrys and stuff im totally down to draw for you and make edits of your favs :3!  </p>
<p align="center"> despite me being social most of the time when around others, i am offtab the majority of the time. please whisper me to grab my attention! <3   </p>
  <p align="center"> i get quite
  nervous about making good impressions, so i may be a bit withdrawn with meeting new people. if i get a bit quiet/blunt at times i promise im not ignoring you being bothered by you or anything!</p>
  <p align="center"> on another note, i hide and block people on here freely. if someones affecting me in a way i dont see fit ill hide em. its usually for a decent reason but sometimes i just do it to clear up space on my screen. if i hide a friend of yours or someone who wishes to talk to me n i hid them for no reason let me know! </p>
 <p align="center"> Undertale yellow is like my favorite thing ever... PLEASEEEE be my friend if you enjoy it even just a tad.... and if you like undertale please look into it!! its so awesome trust me! :)!! </p>
 <p align="center"> Thats pretty much it! Just be patient and kind and we'll get along very well! </p>
